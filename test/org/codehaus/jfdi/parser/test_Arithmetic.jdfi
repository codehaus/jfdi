#basic arithmetic
q = 1 + 2
val = q + 3
val2 = (q * z - 42) / 6
val3 = 7% #I think % should be automatically converted to 0.07 Float or BigDecimal ??


#date arithmetic "-" will be overloaded at runtime as we know Left argument "someDate" is a date
dt = someDate - "10-Jul-1974"


#OPTIONAL section for Bob to think about
#possibly the following are equivalent, IF % is NEXT TO a NUMBER? OR too dangerous as
# % means mod?
rate = 7% of someValue
rate = 7% * someValue

#the following would be cool
premium = someValue + (7% of total)
