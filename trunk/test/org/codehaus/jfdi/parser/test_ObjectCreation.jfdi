#shows creating objects
foo = new FooBar #no params
bar = new BarBaz("x", 42)

#the object creators will need to "call out" to a type resolver to actually create the object
#this allows it to work transparently with classes, or fact templates

#for extra points:
#calls defaults constructor, THEN setters
bar = new BarBaz(field1 = "val", field2 = "x")
