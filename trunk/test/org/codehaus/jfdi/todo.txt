CRITICAL:
* Need to allow single quote chars.
* Additive/mult of BigDecimal/pluggable overrides (mix literal with var)
* field access as a.b.c (property getters).
* Cool assignment a(b = "c")
* Cool setters: a.b = "c"
* Optional brackets for methods


NICE:
* !! Runtime type detection for a.b['c']
* optional ";" allow EOL when needed.
* Date handling
