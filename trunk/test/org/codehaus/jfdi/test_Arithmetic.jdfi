#basic arithmetic
q = 1 + 2
val = q + 3
val2 = (q * z - 42) / 6
val3 = 7% #I think % should be automatically converted to 0.07 Float or BigDecimal

#note: EVERY expression should return a value, just like in ruby. So the first one above will 
#return the value of 3 (for q), and so on. 
#not sure about multiple assignments on one line - either one per line, or ";" delimited?
